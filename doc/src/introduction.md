# Introduction

`nain4` has 3 main goals:

1. Enabling writing `Geant4` application code much more concisely: increasing the signal to noise ratio of `Geant4` code.

2. Making it easy to write automated tests for `Geant4` application code.

3. Promoting `Geant4` errors from run-time to compile-time.

## Why is it called `nain4`?

*Géant* and *nain* are French words:

+ *Géant*: giant (noun); giant, huge (adjectives)
+ *Nain*: dwarf, midget (nouns); dwarf, miniature (adjectives)

With `nain4`, you can express in a tiny amount of code, that which would take huge amounts of code to express in plain `Geant4`; turn your gigantic source files into miniature ones, without loss of meaning.

## How should I pronounce `nain4`?

Rendered in the International Phonetic Alphabet, the pronunciation of the French  word *nain*, is \nɛ̃\\.


In English this is, very roughly, something like *nuh*. 

This sound tends to get drowned out and sound odd, in the middle of a sentence spoken
in English, and many other languages. Therefore feel free to pronounce it
*nano*. In Spanish, *enano* is especially appropriate.
