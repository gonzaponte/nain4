Many of the tests check physical quantities. Dividing physical
quantities by their units gives raw numbers which are easily
understandable by a human reader, which is important when test
failures are reported. Sometimes this gives rise to the apparently
superfluous division by the same unit on both sides of an equation, in
the source code.
